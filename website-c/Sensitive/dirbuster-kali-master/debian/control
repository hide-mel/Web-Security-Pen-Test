Description: Web server directory brute-forcer
 DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to
 brute force directories and files names on web/application
 servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web
 server in a state of default installation is actually not,
 and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster
 attempts to find these.
 .
 However tools of this nature are often as only good as the
 directory and file list they come with. A different
 approach was taken to generating this. The list was
 generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and
 collecting the directory and files that are actually used
 by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different
 lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding
 those hidden files and directories. And if that was not
 enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure
 brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files
 nowhere to hide.
