# Project Artemis

## Testing Scenario

You have recently graduated from your cyber security degree and have formed “We Test Pens Incorporated”.

InHR is a startup that is about to launch an HR portal and has hired you to perform an exhaustive penetration test of its web application prior to go-live. The organisation has strict timelines and would like to publically launch the product on the Monday following your delivery of the penetration testing report.

InHR has selected you for this task due to the high reputation of your cyber security degree, and a belief that you will perform with a very high degree of skill. Due to being a startup, the organisation has a limited budget and was not able to set up a full testing environment. You will be performing all your testing in a production environment and therefore must use great care and skill, performing only manual penetration testing, while being acutely aware of your behaviour in the organisation's environment to prevent potential denial of service attacks.

As you are now a professional, your goal is to present your findings in a high quality report for delivery at the end of this engagement. The quality of your work and the effort that you put in cannot be judged without a quality report detailing all your findings, potential consequences, and recommended remediations. 

## Scope

Testing must only be performed on http://assignment-artemis.unimelb.life/
Testing must be manual only. Manual tools may be used (Burp, Zap, etc), however you may not use the automated scanning capabilities of these tools.
No automated scanning or automated tools can be used.
No load testing, denial of service (DOS) or distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. You may use Burp’s Intruder, but use less than 30 payloads per minute.
