# Web Security

Web Security will look at a number of aspects of web security, with a focus on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list from 2017 (this is the current industry standard). The subject is intended to mix theory and application, as well as examining real-world case studies of vulnerabilities. The subject aims to develop an awareness of the vulnerabilities that a web application is likely to face, and an understanding of the types of mitigation strategies that can be deployed. We will stress heavily on the  practical aspect of every vulnerability.
